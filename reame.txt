Thank for coming to one or more of my talks at DevIntersection in Las Vegas! 

You'll find subdirectories for each talk with the PowerPoint deck and any other files. For demo code, check out the links below. Demo code is to learn from, and probably not directly appropriate for your apps. Look for the DevIntersection 2022 branches. In most cases, Main is empty or massively out of date.
